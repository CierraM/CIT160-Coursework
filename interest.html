    /*Create an HTML document that looks similar to figure 9-6 in the textbook. Write two functions with these headers:

function doFV()
function computeFutureValue(principal, annualRate, years, periodsPerYear)
The user interface for an investment calculator
Figure 9-6: The user interface for an investment calculator.
The first function (doFV)

takes no parameters
is called from the onclick attribute
gets input from the user
calls the computeFutureValue function
displays the result to the user
The second function (computeFutureValue) computes and returns the future value of an investment. The 
formula for computing the future value of an investment is

f = a (1 + r)n
where f is the future value, a is the investment amount sometimes called the principal, r is the growth rate per 
period, and n is the total number of periods throughout the life of the investment.
